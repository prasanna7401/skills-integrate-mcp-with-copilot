# Add admin UI or simple server-rendered pages

Create minimal admin web pages (or an SPA) for enrollment, editing student profiles, and deletion—mirroring the features of the reference PHP repo. Use templates (Jinja2) or a small React/Vue app.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Basic admin pages to list, create, edit, delete students and activities
- Pages served via FastAPI (Jinja2) or separate SPA with API integration
- README with dev steps to run the UI
