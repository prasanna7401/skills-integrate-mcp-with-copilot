# Student profiles CRUD endpoints

Add endpoints to create/read/update/delete student profiles (admission number, name, year, DOB, gender, branch, semester, contact, assigned faculty, etc.). Validate inputs and add DB constraints.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Endpoints: `GET /students`, `GET /students/{id}`, `POST /students`, `PUT /students/{id}`, `DELETE /students/{id}`
- Data validation with Pydantic models
- Database schema and migrations updated
